Zen Killers is another game in the vein of Arms Race or Gun game. There is a tower of weapons you must climb in order to win the game, but the twist for Zen Killers is that a single knife hit will send you back to the bottom!

Features:
- Totally pluggable. Use any weapons from the HL2, Counter-Strike, or any other mod you have downloaded.
- Instant kill knife, sends any other player back to the bottom of the tower with a single hit
- The annihilation your preconceived notions of "fairness" or "winnable".

How to add new towers:
Towers are just lists of weapons stored in the garrysmod/data/zenkillers/ folder. The file has the form
weapon_classname1,Pretty Name 1
weapon_classname2,Pretty Name 2
...
Etc. See https://youtu.be/pCO49NdvI50 for a step by step guide on how to find weapon class names and build a new tower.
